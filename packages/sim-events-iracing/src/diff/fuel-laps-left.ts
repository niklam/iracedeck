/**
 * Estimated "laps of fuel left" callout crossings (issue #838).
 *
 * Once per lap, at the mid-lap `LapDistPct` 0.5 crossing, computes how many
 * FULL laps the driver can complete after finishing the current lap:
 *
 *   rawLapsLeft = FuelLevel / avg          (validated estimator, issue #465)
 *   effective   = rawLapsLeft − margin     (user margin, default 0.3 laps)
 *   count       = max(0, floor(effective − remaining lap fraction))
 *
 * and emits `fuel.lapsLeft.crossed { count, lapsLeft }` when `count` is a NEW
 * descending crossing for the stint. `count === 0` is the "box this lap for
 * fuel" call. The estimator is the same `getFuelStats()` source Session
 * Info's Laps to Empty display uses (issue #748), over the same default
 * 5-lap window, so the spoken number tracks the displayed one (minus the
 * deliberately conservative margin).
 *
 * Announcement rules:
 *   - Each count fires at most once per stint, and only on a DESCENDING
 *     crossing — fuel saving that raises the estimate never re-announces a
 *     higher count, and a count already spoken stays spoken.
 *   - A drop of several counts between samples emits only the current
 *     (smallest crossed) count — no stale burst (the start-countdown ceiling
 *     precedent, issues #480/#666).
 *   - A refuel re-arms every count for the new stint: any debounced per-tick
 *     `FuelLevel` increase clears the announced floor. A garage refuel lands
 *     as one large delta on the first live tick back (the previous-level
 *     tracker is preserved across the replay wipe — see `TranslatorState`).
 *
 * Race sessions only, live in car, and silent until the tracker has valid
 * samples — no estimate, no callout, never a guess.
